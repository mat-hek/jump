Revision of another repository (https://github.com/apisarek/malus)

malus project by A. Pisarek & B. Sumper

Remarks:
- README not at all descriptive - no clue how to use/launch project
- some very long functions with inlined transfomrations and pipelines, what causes problems in understanding at first glance
- non-consistent style of pipelinenig operations
- lines of documentation vs complexity
- whitekeys holes somewhere in the code
+ usage of many external dependencies
+ short, informative functions name 
+ example of easy REST API 
+ functions declarations lifted up for better visisbility 
+ usage of functors, monads, applicatives 
+ usage of higher order typeclasses (even those not included in compulsory part of course)
+ lines of code vs provided functionalities
